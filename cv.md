### Briefly about myself

I've started my journey in programming learning C++ intending to be a backend developer. So far, learning other directions in Computer Science I've decided to learn Web Development, because it gives me endless possibilities for professional growth and being part of a world-changing community.

### Code examples:
__Solution from my freeCodeCamp course:__
_Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays._
```
function diffArray(arr1, arr2) {
  return arr1
    .concat(arr2)
    .filter(item => !arr1.includes(item) || !arr2.includes(item));
}

diffArray([1, 2, 3, 5], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```
